# Exercise 1: Vowel or Consonant
#
# Write a Python function named `check_letter` that determines if a given letter
# is a vowel or a consonant.
#
# Requirements:
# - The function should prompt the user to enter a letter (a-z or A-Z) and determine its type.
# - It should handle both uppercase and lowercase letters.
# - If the letter is a vowel (a, e, i, o, u), print: "The letter x is a vowel."
# - If the letter is a consonant, print: "The letter x is a consonant."
# - Replace 'x' with the actual letter entered by the user.
#
# Hints:
# - Use the `input()` function to capture user input.
# - Utilize the `in` operator to check for vowels.
# - Ensure to provide feedback for non-alphabetical or invalid entries.

def check_letter():
    # Your control flow logic goes here
    letter = input("Enter a letter (a-z or A-Z) to check if it is a vowel: ").lower()
    
    if len(letter) != 1 or not letter.isalpha():
        print("Invalid input")
        return
    
    vowels = "aeiou"
    
    if letter in vowels:
        print(f"{letter} is a vowel.")
    else:
        print(f"{letter} is a consonant.")
        
# Call the function
# check_letter()


# Exercise 2: Old enough to vote?
#
# Write a Python function named `check_voting_eligibility` that determines if a user is old enough to vote.
# Fill in the logic to perform the eligibility check inside the function.
#
# Function Details:
# - Prompt the user to input their age: "Please enter your age: "
# - Validate the input to ensure the age is a possible value (no negative numbers).
# - Determine if the user is eligible to vote. Set a variable for the voting age.
# - Print a message indicating whether the user is eligible to vote based on the entered age.
#
# Hints:
# - Use the `input()` function to capture the user's age.
# - Use `int()` to convert the input to an integer. Ensure to handle any conversion errors gracefully.
# - Use a conditional statement to check if the age meets the minimum voting age requirement.

def check_voting_eligibility():
    # Your control flow logic goes here
    age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
    
    if age < 0:
        print("Age must be older that 0")
    elif age >= 18:
        print(f"{age} is an eligible voting age.")
    else:
        print(f"{age} is an ineligible voting age.")

# Call the function
# check_voting_eligibility()


# Exercise 3: Calculate Dog Years
#
# Write a Python function named `calculate_dog_years` that calculates a dog's age in dog years.
# Fill in the logic to perform the calculation inside the function.
#
# Function Details:
# - Prompt the user to enter a dog's age: "Input a dog's age: "
# - Calculate the dog's age in dog years:
#      - The first two years of the dog's life count as 10 dog years each.
#      - Each subsequent year counts as 7 dog years.
# - Print the calculated age: "The dog's age in dog years is xx."
# - Replace 'xx' with the calculated dog years.
#
# Hints:
# - Use the `input()` function to capture user input.
# - Convert the string input to an integer using `int()`.
# - Apply conditional logic to perform the correct age calculation based on the dog's age.

def calculate_dog_years():
    # Your control flow logic goes here
    age = int(input("Input a dog's age: "))
    
    if age <= 2:
        dog_years = age * 10
    else:
        dog_years = 20 + (age - 2) * 7
    
    print(f"The dog's age in dog years is {dog_years}")
    
# Call the function
# calculate_dog_years()

# Exercise 4: Weather Advice
#
# Write a Python script named `weather_advice` that provides clothing advice based on weather conditions.
#
# Requirements:
# - The script should prompt the user to enter if it is cold (yes/no).
# - Then, ask if it is raining (yes/no).
# - Use logical operators to determine clothing advice:
#   - If it is cold AND raining, print "Wear a waterproof coat."
#   - If it is cold BUT NOT raining, print "Wear a warm coat."
#   - If it is NOT cold but raining, print "Carry an umbrella."
#   - If it is NOT cold AND NOT raining, print "Wear light clothing."
#
# Hints:
# - Use logical operators (`AND`, `OR`, `NOT`) in your if statements to handle multiple conditions.

def weather_advice():
    # Your control flow logic goes here
    cold = input("Is it cold? (yes/no)").lower()
    rain = input("Is is raining? (yes/no)").lower()
    
    is_cold = cold == "yes"
    is_rain = rain == "yes"
    
    if is_cold and is_rain:
        print("Wear a waterproof coat.")
    elif is_cold and not is_rain:
        print("Wear a warm coat.")
    elif not is_cold and is_rain:
        print("Carry an umbrella.")
    else:
        print("Wear light clothing.")
# Call the function
weather_advice()
